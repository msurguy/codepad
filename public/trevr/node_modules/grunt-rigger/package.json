  "readme": "# grunt-rigger\n\nThis is a [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) plugin for the [buildJS](https://github.com/buildjs) tool [rigger](https://github.com/buildjs/rigger). \n\nRigger provides targetted include functionality (similar to [sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets)) but with some additional functionality.  A highlight of rigger functionality is outlined below:\n\n- Simple include format for including files using a special comment syntax (`//= foo.js`)\n- Ability to include remote resources as well as local: (`http://github.com/buildjs/shims/string/trim.js`)\n- Ability to intelligently transpile from [coffee-script](https://coffeescript.org), [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/), etc to their natural web equivalents (js, css, etc).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use `grunt-rigger` you will need to include it in your `package.json` file (I'd recommend under the `devDependencies` section):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"myproject\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"coffee-script\": \"1.3.x\",\n    \"grunt-rigger\": \"0.4.x\"\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou will see in the example above, `coffee-script` is also included in the `devDependencies` section.  In cases where you would like to leverage riggers ability to transpile files (e.g. `.coffee` => `.js`) you will need to include the appropriate node package in your `devDependencies` as these are not automatically included in rigger itself (to avoid library bloat).\n\nUsing `grunt-rigger` within grunt itself is very simple.  Consider the following sample `grunt.js` file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) {\n    grunt.initConfig({\n        rig: {\n            compile: {        \n                options: {\n                    banner: '/* THIS BANNER USES TEMPLATE FUNCTIONALITY <%= banner_property %> */\\n',\n                    footer: '\\n/* SOME FOOTER */'\n                },\n                files: {\n                    'dist/simple.js': ['src/simple.js']\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-rigger');\n};\n```\n\nThat should be pretty much it, if your source file contains any [rigger](https://github.com/buildjs/rigger) comments they will be parsed and executed accordingly.",
